## Acquiring and Cleaning the Data
* Go to the UC Office of the President Website and navigate to Organization -> Financial Accounting -> Financial Reports -> [Campus Financial Schedules](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/index.html). Download the PDF file for Berkeley for the past five fiscal years: [2019-2020](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/19-20/berkeley.pdf), [2018-2019](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/18-19/berkeley.pdf), [2017-2018](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/17-18/berkeley-consolidated.pdf), [2016-2017](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/16-17/berkeley-consolidated.pdf), and [2015-2016](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/15-16/berkeley-consolidated.pdf).
* Use an optical character recognition (OCR) program such as [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) to convert the PDF to Excel. 
* Extract the tables for Instruction funding for the major UC Berkeley colleges, including the College of Engineering, School of Business Administration, College of Chemistry, School of Education, Graduate School of Journalism, School of Law, College of Letters and Science, School of Information Management, College of Natural Resources, School of Optometry, School of Public Health, Graduate School of Public Policy, and School of Social Welfare. Include department breakdowns when available. 
* Clean the data by standardizing department names with title case in Open Refine, formatting values as dollar amounts, and consolidating the data into one worksheet.
* Use the VLOOKUP formula to match up the department names with their funding in one spreadsheet.
* Find errors and manually check and fix the data entries. Some department names may not be adequately parsed by OCR, causing inaccuracies.
* Make the data easier to read by putting college names in bold and freezing the first column and rows up to the year.

  strategic planning for CoE 
  PIs?
  how has the curriculum changed? (MSE 45 lab)
