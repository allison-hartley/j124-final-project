## By Allison Hartley

## Data Analysis Process
* Go to the UC Office of the President Website and navigate to Organization -> Financial Accounting -> Financial Reports -> [Campus Financial Schedules](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/index.html). Download the PDF file for Berkeley for the past five fiscal years: [2019-2020](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/19-20/berkeley.pdf), [2018-2019](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/18-19/berkeley.pdf), [2017-2018](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/17-18/berkeley-consolidated.pdf), [2016-2017](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/16-17/berkeley-consolidated.pdf), and [2015-2016](https://www.ucop.edu/financial-accounting/financial-reports/campus-financial-schedules/15-16/berkeley-consolidated.pdf).
* Use an optical character recognition (OCR) program to convert the PDF to Excel. [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/) will work; extract the tables for Instruction and Research funds for the engineering department.
* Clean the data by standardizing department names with title case, formatting values as dollar amounts, and consolidating the data into one worksheet.
